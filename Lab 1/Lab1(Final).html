<h4><center><p>Hello there, visitors! This is a website that has all-things related to chess. I would like to take you through the basics of chess, and then slowly get to more complicated concepts.</p>
<p>But before everything else, let me tell you about the history of the game.</p></center></h4>
<b><center><h2>History</h2></b></center>
<p>Chess, as we know it today, was born out of the Indian game <a href = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaturanga><i>Chaturanga</i></a> before the 600s AD. The game spread throughout Asia and Europe over the coming centuries, and eventually evolved into what we know as chess around the 16th century. One of the first masters of the game was a Spanish priest named Ruy Lopez. Although he didn't invent the opening named after him, he analyzed it in a book he published in 1561.</p>

<b><center><h3>The Romantic Era</h3></b></center>
<p>Romantic chess was the style of chess prevalent from the 18th century until the 1880s. Chess games of this period emphasized quick, tactical maneuvers rather than long-term strategic planning. The Romantic era of play was followed by the Scientific, Hypermodern, and New Dynamism eras, Games during this era generally consisted of 1.e4 openings such as the King's Gambit and Giuoco Piano. Queen-side pawn openings were not popular and seldom played. The Romantic era is generally considered to have ended with the 1873 Vienna tournament where Wilhelm Steinitz popularized positional play and the closed game. This domination ushered in a new age of chess known as the "Modern", or Classical school, which would last until the 1930s when hypermodernism began to become popular.</p>
<p>The Romantic era is generally considered to have reached its peak with Alexander McDonnell and Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais, the two dominant chess players of the 1830s.[citation needed] The 1840s were dominated by Howard Staunton, and other leading players of the era included Adolf Anderssen, Daniel Harrwitz, Henry Bird, Louis Paulsen, and Paul Morphy.</p>
<p>The Immortal Game, played by Anderssen and Lionel Kieseritzky on 21 June 1851 in London—where Anderssen made bold sacrifices to secure victory, giving up both rooks and a bishop, then his queen, and then checkmating his opponent with his three remaining minor pieces—is considered a supreme example of Romantic chess.</p>
<b><center><h3>The Classical Era</h3></center></b>
<p>Wilhelm Steinitz, reigned as world champion until 1894, when he was 58. The Prague-born Steinitz managed to retain his superiority for so long because he developed new principles of the middlegame, particularly in closed or semiclosed positions, that only his successor, Emanuel Lasker, and Lasker’s contemporaries fully appreciated. Steinitz said his “modern school” was guided by two premises: first, that the natural outcome of a game is a draw because of the inherent balance between the forces of White and Black and, second, that checkmate is the ultimate but not the first objective of the game.</p>

<p>Steinitz began his career as a tactical, combinational player in the Morphy style. But in his late thirties he developed insight into subtle positional characteristics that take precedence in positions in which the centre is fully or partially blocked by immobile pawns. Steinitz tried to answer the mystery of why some attacks succeed, regardless of how skillful the defender, while others fail, regardless of how talented the attacker. A failed attack, he added, often results in defeat for the attacker, whose forces suddenly become poorly coordinated in the face of a counterattack.</p>

<p>Steinitz was also the first master of defensive play. Even when playing the White pieces, he often invited his opponent to open the centre by exchanging pawns or to be the first to cross the fourth rank. He reasoned that such attacks must be premature if the equilibrium was in balance and so could be punished after patient defensive play.</p>

<b><center><h2>FIDE</h2></center></b>
<p>The International Chess Federation or World Chess Federation, commonly referred to by its French acronym FIDE (/ˈfiːdeɪ/ FEE-day Fédération Internationale des Échecs), is an international organization based in Switzerland that connects the various national chess federations and acts as the governing body of international chess competition. FIDE was founded in Paris, France, on July 20, 1924. Its motto is Gens una sumus, Latin for "We are one people". In 1999, FIDE was recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). As of September 2020, there are 195 member federations of FIDE.</p>

<p>FIDE's most visible activity is organizing the World Chess Championship since 1948. FIDE also organizes world championships for women, juniors, seniors, and the disabled.[7] Another flagship event is the Chess Olympiad, a biennial chess tournament organized since 1924, in which national teams compete. In alternate years, FIDE also organizes the World Team Championship, in which the best teams from the previous Olympiad compete.</p>

<p>As part of the World Chess Championship cycle, FIDE also organizes the Candidates Tournament, which determines who will challenge the reigning World Champion, and the qualifying tournaments for the Candidates, such as the Chess World Cup, the FIDE Grand Prix, and the FIDE Grand Swiss Tournament 2019.</p>

<center><b><h2>Openings in Chess</h2></b></center>
<p>The first few moves in the game of chess is referred to as the "opening" stage of the game. Currently there are a vast number of openings in chess, and modern chess depends heavily on openings at the highest level played. Openings can sometimes even decide who has the upper hand in the game.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of popular openings played at the highest level today.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Italian Game</li>
		<li>Ruy Lopez (Spanish Game)</li>
		<li>Sicilian Defense</li>
		<li>Queen's Gambit</li>
		<li>London System</li>
		<li>Dutch Defense</li>
	</ul>
<center><b><h2>Board Setup</h2></b></center>
<p>Chess is a 1v1 board game played between two players on an 8*8 checkered board and two sets of pieces. Chess pieces are separated by colour, with each player getting a set of colours. While the sets may not be literally white and black (e.g. the light set may be a yellowish or off-white color, the dark set may be brown or red), they are always referred to as "white" and "black". The players of the sets are referred to as White and Black, respectively. Each set consists of 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns.

The game is played on a square board of eight rows (called ranks) and eight columns (called files). By convention, the 64 squares alternate in color and are referred to as light and dark squares; common colors for chessboards are white and brown, or white and dark green.</p>
<p>The mechanic that is used to notate the game is called the "Algebraic notation".</p>

<ul>
	<li>King: K</li>
	<li>Queen: Q</li>
	<li>Knight: N</li>
	<li>Bishop: B</li>
	<li>Rook: R</li>
	<li>Pawn: </li>
</ul>
<p>The notation goes as follows: Each square on the board is notated by an alphabet-number pair. The alphabet, i.e., the column (file) that the square is on, is first written, then the number i.e., the row (rank) that the square is on is written.</p>

<p>So, as you can see in the picture, the square that has been circled, is on the e-column (file) and the 4th row (rank). This square is notated as e4.</p>

<p>Like this, each square, starting from the bottom left corner, is given an alphabet-number pair, i.e., a1 to h8.</p>
<p>The pieces and their movements are as follows:</p>
    <dl>
        <b><dt>King</dt></b>
            <dd>The most important piece on the board.The king controls 8 squares on the board from the centre. It can move like a Queen, i.e., horizontally, vertically and diagonally, but can only move one square.</dd>

        <b><dt>Queen</dt></b>
            <dd>The queen controls 27 squares on the board from the centre. It is the strongest piece on the board. It can move both like a bishop, and like a rook, i.e., it can move horizontally, vertically and diagonally.</dd>

        <b><dt>Rook</dt></b>

        <b><dt>Knight</dt></b>
            <dd>Knight controls 8 squares on the board from the centre. Each knight can move in an L shape, 3 squares away. A knight can only move on alternating colours.</dd>

        <b><dt>Bishop</dt></b>
            <dd>Bishop controls 13 squares on the board from the centre. Each bishop can only move on the diagonals of the same colour it was initially on the board.</dd>
